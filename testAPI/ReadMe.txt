 Here Iam used request module to get the details from api
 
 You can run the code iusing the url:http://localhost:3000/users/getDetails?search=people
 
 serach is the keyword used for :To search element in api like : people or planets or starships

 then u get the all the details of api included data

 AS per your requirement i need to use pagination module but i didnt used that module in my experience.
 
 Even though i tried but i didn't get properly.so i tried using request module 
 
 Here requset module only reads the api content but not give the limited response.
